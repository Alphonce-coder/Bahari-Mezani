# System Design for Bahari Mezani

## 1. Architecture
The project follows a **React Application ** architecture. Below is the proposed architecture:

- **Frontend**: React.js with React Router for navigation and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Supabase for backend services (authentication, database, and APIs).
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for storing user data, feedback, and project details.
- **Hosting**:
  - Frontend: Deployed on **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
  - Backend: Managed by **Supabase**.

- **AboutUs**: Introduces the team and mission of Bahari Mezani.
- **Services**: Lists the services offered, such as aquaculture and waste management.
- **Projects**: Highlights ongoing and completed projects with images and descriptions.
- **Feedback**: Displays testimonials from partners and community members.
- **Contacts**: Provides a contact form and location details with an embedded Google Map.

## 3. Features
- **Static Content**: Most pages (e.g., About, Services) display static content.
- **Dynamic Content**: Feedback and Projects sections can be dynamically fetched from Supabase.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app is mobile-friendly using TailwindCSS or custom CSS.

## 4. Backend API Design (Supabase)
Supabase provides built-in APIs for interacting with the database. Below are the suggested endpoints:

| Endpoint               | Method | Description                          |
|------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `/projects`            | GET    | Fetch all projects                  |
| `/feedback`            | GET    | Fetch all feedback/testimonials     |
| `/contact`             | POST   | Submit contact form data            |
| `/newsletter`          | POST   | Subscribe to the newsletter         |

These endpoints can be accessed via Supabase's RESTful API or client libraries.
